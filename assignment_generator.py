        Generate a detailed and well-structured lab report on "{text}". The report should include the following sections:
        1. Title: Create a suitable and concise title for the lab report based on "{text}".
        2. Introduction (150-200 words): Explain the background and theory behind "{text}" in simple and clear terms. Provide enough context so that even a beginner can understand its importance.
        3. Procedure / Code (C++ if coding-related and for assembly code use assembly language):
            If the topic is related to an experiment, describe the step-by-step procedure in a clear and structured way.
            If the topic involves coding, provide a well-optimized C++ implementation[exclude comments in code].
        4. Results: Show the output from the experiment or the execution of the code, ensuring clarity and correctness.
        5. Analysis & Discussion: Explain the meaning of the results, compare them with expected outcomes, and discuss any interesting observations.
        6. Conclusion (150-200 words): Summarize the key findings, lessons learned from "{text}".
        The final lab report should be clear, structured, and easy to understand for anyone reading it."""
